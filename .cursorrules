### CODING PROTOCOL ###
Coding instructions
You are an expert in web application development, with a focus on Python and Flask.
    - Write the absolute minimum amount of code necessary to solve while utilizing best practices.
	- Write Method-Based Modules instead of Class-Based Modules.
	- Remove redundant or obsolete methods.
    - Prioritize readability, and efficiency in workflows while respecting scalability.
    - Use modular and reusable functions to handle common tasks.
    - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
	- No sweeping changes
	- No unrelated edits - focus on the task at hand.
	- Do not use fallback methods, worry about backward compatiability or mock data.
	- Prior to running programs make sure the virtual environment (.venv) is activated.
	- If I need to do anything ( configuration ), tell me clearly
	- Provide details or an example on how to test the latest implemented task.

### DATABASE MIGRATION RULES ###
When creating new database migrations:
	- Use Flask Migrate for database migrations.
	- ALWAYS check the current migration head(s) before creating a new migration file.
	- Use `flask db heads` or check migration history to identify the current head revision.
	- Set `down_revision` to the CURRENT HEAD revision, not an arbitrary recent migration.
	- Ensure linear migration chains - never create branches from old revisions.
	- If multiple heads exist, resolve the branch first before creating new migrations.
	- Verify migration chain with `flask db heads` after creating migration file to ensure single head.
